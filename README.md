### Hello Friend :wave:
If you believe there's a paper, problem, or project, especially in the domains of AI, CTF, or Competitive Programming that could benefit from an open-source implementation, I'd love to hear from you! Please use this form [link](https://forms.gle/rCd5WCq74tR46e659) to share your ideas or reach out to me directly via mail or Discord. I welcome all suggestions!


### Projects
- **llama.jl** Inference Llama 2 in one file of pure C. Nahh wait, now fresh in Julia!
- **CoPE-cuda** Contextual Position Encoding but with some custom CUDA Kernels https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18719
- **Competitive-Coding-Benchmark** Benchmark LLMs against a set of high quality representative competitive coding problems sourced from cses.fi
- **nngdb**  An terminal based neural-network Interpretability-tool that feels like gdb
- **cudatiger** An accelerated implementation of the Tiger optimizer for PyTorch, supercharged with Triton for enhanced CUDA GPU efficiency. More Memory efficient than Adam. https://kexue.fm/archives/9512
- **tinyfep** A simplified and abstracted rendition of FEP+ (Free Energy Perturbation) for molecular simulations. https://www.schrodinger.com/products/fep

### Models
- **[juvi21/Hermes-2.5-Yi-1.5-9B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/juvi21/Hermes-2.5-Yi-1.5-9B-Chat)** with GGUF and Quantization. Outperforms many models in it's class on AGIEval. More details in the model-card.
- **[juvi21/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-infinity](https://huggingface.co/juvi21/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-infinity)** with GGUF and Quantization. More details in the model-card.


### Datasets
- **[cses-fi-competitive-coding-problems](https://huggingface.co/datasets/juvi21/cses-fi-competitive-coding-problems)** Highly representative set of competitive coding problems from cses.fi in a nice dataformat.
